# DANS Artificial Intelligence Service (POC)

This work is based on [Slava Tykhonovâ€™s](https://github.com/Dans-labs/spacy-dans) work.

This project was set up with Poetry, a dependency management tool for Python: [Poetry docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/). 
We can import it in PyCharm/IntelliJ/VS Code, with the Poetry Plugin installed, and run or debug the code from the IDE while also editing it to fit our needs.

## Deep Learning POC
Deep learning is a part of machine learning that can directly process text, image, or sound without the manual help of an expert. It learns from large amounts of data which is in fact advantageous in its achieving a state-of-the-art level of accuracy. A deep learning model is designed to continuously analyze this data with a logical structure that is close to the way humans draw conclusions. To achieve this, deep learning applications use a layered structure of algorithms called an artificial neural network.

### Dataverse Files - Archaeology Artifacts Recognition

DANS has numerous archaeological datasets. Having large amounts of archaeological data is a good fit for the deep learning model as the former can be reused to further refine the latter into an even cleverer piece of technology. All in all, the many studies that exist can be further explored and any artefact we find can be easily identified and traced to its source.
To illustrate, we have the Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) algorithm that we can use to search for objects based on examples, such as the differing locations of burial mounds.
There are many studies regarding this, one of which is a great example of deep learning that can be used as a reference: "[A deep-learning model for predictive archaeology and archaeological community detection](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-021-00970-z)"
