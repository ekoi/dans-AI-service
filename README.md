# dans-machine-learning-service

This work is based on [Slava Tykhonov](https://github.com/Dans-labs/spacy-dans) work.

This project was setup with Poetry, a dependency management tool for Python: [Poetry docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/). 
We can import it in PyCharm/IntelliJ/VS Code with the Poetry Plugin installed and running the code from the IDE, while editing it to our needs.
